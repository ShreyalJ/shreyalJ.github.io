## Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO) Review

After passing PNPT last year and working on several network penetration tests and assumed breach assessments, I decided to go for CRTO. This blog post will include a review of the course, labs and the exam.

### Timeline

In July, I purchased the course and lab package with the 4 month EMI option. Then I scheduled the exam in October. 
Please don't assume that it can take this long to prepare. The reason I took 4 months for preparation was because I was irregular in practice due to college and job stuff. Depending on individuals' prior knowledge or the time they can dedicate, a couple of months might be sufficient for some. Since the labs can be extended, take as much time as you feel is sufficient for you.

### About The Course and Lab

The course is very thorough and contains topics required to perform a successful red team assessment. You'll learn phishing, post compromise attacks, domain dominance and much more! All the sections have easy to understand reading material and all the techniques have OPSEC considerations with them. So you always know if and how your technique is going to get detected. There are some topics with videos that help with better understanding.

With the course and lab bundle, 40 hr of lab access is provided. All the tools required for practice are already installed on the lab machines. Also, simple copy paste works. You get to work on Cobalt Strike throughout the course and the course contains basic to advance usage of Cobalt Strike. You'll learn everything from simply creating listeners to creating malleable profiles. You can acccess the labs using browser only, no need for any VPN. The 40 hour lab access was more than sufficient for me. It was possible for me to practice twice in that time.

The only drawback I experienced was the connection issues in the lab. I got disconnected multiple times while practicing.

### The Exam

The exam time provided is 48 hours and these 48 hours can be used in 4 days. This is possible because you're allowed to pause the labs anytime you want. I scheduled the exam on a Thursday starting from 10 AM. I could use those 48 hours anyday from Thursday to Monday morning. Before the exam started I created the threat profile (covered in course) required to get started with the exam. I would recommend to do so after scheduling the exam only to save some time afterwards.

Alike the labs, I experienced connection issues a few times during the exam as well.

### When can someone take CRTO?

Please note that this is not a beginner level certification. Anyone with prior Active Directory and attacks knowledge should go for it. 

If you're new to network penetration testing or Active Directory, I would suggest to first go for other beginner level certifications like PNPT from TCM security or CRTP that focuses more on Active Directory Attacks. I didn't go for CRTP after getting PNPT certified since I PNPT already gave me abasic foundation of Active Directory and a few attacks. I found myself ready to take up CRTO course and I went for it.
