## Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO) Review

I passed the CRTO Exam last week. I passed PNPT last year and after finally getting out some time, I purchased the CRTO course + labs package.

#### Timeline

In July, I Purchased the course and lab package with the 4 month EMI option. And I scheduled the exam in October. Don't assume that the course and lab can take this long to prepare. The reason I took 4 months for preparation was because I was irregular in practice due to college and job stuff.
Depending on individuals' prior knowledge or the time they can dedicate, a couple of months might be sufficient for some and some might take more. Since the labs can be extended, take as much time as you feel is sufficient for you.
