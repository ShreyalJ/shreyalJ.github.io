## Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO) Review

After passing PNPT last year and working on several network pentests and assumed breach assessments, I decided to go for CRTO. This blog post will include a review on the course, labs and the exam.

#### Timeline

In July, I purchased the course and lab package with the 4 month EMI option. Then I scheduled the exam in October. 
Please don't assume that it can take this long to prepare. The reason I took 4 months for preparation was because I was irregular in practice due to college and job stuff. Depending on individuals' prior knowledge or the time they can dedicate, a couple of months might be sufficient for some and some might take more. Since the labs can be extended, take as much time as you feel is sufficient for you.

#### About The Course and Lab

The course is very thorough and contains every topic required to perform a successful red team assessment. You'll learn phishing, post compromise attacks, domain dominance and much more! All the sections have easy to understand reading material and all the techniques have OPSEC considerations with them. So you always know if and how your technique is going to get detected. There are some topics with videos that help with better understanding.

With the course and lab bundle, 40 hr of lab access is provided. All the tools required for practice are already installed on the lab machines. Also, simple copy paste works. You get to work on Cabalt Strike throughout the course and the course contains basic to advance usage of Cobalt Strike. You'll learn everything from simply creating listeners to creating malleable profiles. Best thing is you can acccess the labs using browser only! No need for any VPN.
